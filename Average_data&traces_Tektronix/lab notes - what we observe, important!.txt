In the dotted version of the light waveform, we see that the sampling on raman returns seem 
pretty nice, the peak is quite obvious. However, when we look at the Pulse (channel 1), it seems 
like it may be undersampled. Have no comment on Green channel because I cant really see it with 
safety glasses on.

Same kind of idea with the dark version ^.

There is not an enormous amount of difference between the 2 plots. However, there are lots of 
ringing in the green channel and a small amount of ringing in channel 1. The ringing doesn't seem 
to change when we turn the lights off.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT I DIDNT EVEN HAVE THE FLASHLIGHT FROM MY PHONE ON.
